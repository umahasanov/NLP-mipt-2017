      "a peacekeeping force led by Brazil has helped bring stability to many Haitian communities.\n",
      "Haiti made these strides with help from its own citizens and many of the nations and institutions represented here\n",

      "among businesses, universities, NG0s, religious and cultural groups, and individuals-the full range of resources and\n",
      "relationships, which is the heart of smart power.\n",
      "That trajectory of progress has been undermined by the combined winds of hurricanes and a global economic recession.\n",
      "Haiti is in danger of stalling.\n",
      "This conference gives us an opportunity to reignite its path to progress and work as a team-with Haiti at the helm-to\n",
      "advance a comprehensive, long-term strategy for Haiti's growth, by coordinating hemispheric and international efforts,\n",
      "targeting clear goals, and deploying our diverse skills and resources efficiently and effectively.\n",
      "President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis have identified what help Haiti needs to get back on track. With these\n",
      "priorities as our guide and Haiti as our partner, we can make high-impact investments that will help lay the foundation\n",
      "for stronger democratic institutions, a vibrant civil society, and an open market economy that creates more stability,\n",
      "attracts international investment, and offers more jobs and wider economic opportunities for Haiti and our region as a\n",
      "whole.\n",
      "Now is the time to step up our investment in Haiti-not because the situation is so dire, but because the consequences of\n",
      "inaction could lead to significantly larger costs in both human and financial terms down the road.\n",
      "With $100, we can pay for a year of schooling for one Haitian child or immunize five. That's a tiny fraction of the cost of\n",
      "solving these problems if they escalate over time.\n",
      "The United States will target our support toward three areas that the Haitian government has requested, which are\n",
      "aimed at promoting conditions that are essential for national and regional progress.\n",
      "First, the Haitian people need to be secure. They must be able to travel safely to work and school and participate in the\n",
      "civic lives of their communities without fear of violence.\n",
      "Second, the country needs stronger infrastructure, particularly roads, which are the circulatory system of any robust\n",
      "economy. Meanwhile, the people of Haiti are ready to work, but jobs are in short supply. We can accomplish two things\n",
      "at once by putting people to work building roads and other infrastructure throughout Haiti.\n",
      "And third, last year's hurricanes blew a hole in the government's budget.\n",
      "Now Haiti is facing a huge deficit, which will make it harder to provide services in the short-term or fund major projects\n",
      "in the long-term. Their debt obligations further constrain their ability to lay the groundwork for the future.\n",
      "On each of these issues-security, jobs and infrastructure, and debt relief-the United States is lending its assistance and\n",
      "seeking to partner with other nations to maximize our collective impact.\n",
      "First, security. Effective international partnerships have already helped stem violence and improve security in Haiti. Cite\n",
      "Soleil, for example, was a no-man's-land for years, but today, violence has subsided and a new sense of freedom is felt in\n",
      "the streets.\n",
      "The Haitian National Police have been supported in their work by the UN peacekeeping operation in Haiti, which is the\n",
      "first in the hemisphere in which Latin American and Caribbean nations have participated. Brazil has led the mission with\n",
      "determination and skill. This level of engagement and collaboration is a major step forward for our region.\n",
      "But criminal networks operating in Haiti have not been eliminated. Haiti continues to fight drug traffickers who have\n",
      "made this country a distribution point for illegal drugs headed to the United States, Canada and Europe.\n",
      "Drug trafficking is a problem that involves many nations, all of which have a role to play in ending this deadly trade. That\n",
      "includes the United States. We will give $2 million to fight drug trafficking in Haiti through the Merida Initiative, a plan\n",
      "conceived by Mexico, Central America and the United States. This money will fund a secure communications network\n",
      "for the Haitian police; provide a maritime base, vehicles and operational support for police drug units; provide training\n",
      "to promote cross-border cooperation between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; and sharpen the investigation and\n",
      "prosecution of drug crimes.\n",
      "Once security is established, opportunity can take root. Nations from Canada to Spain to Japan offered generous\n",
      "assistance to help repair the damage from last year's storms. Now it is time to take the next step-to move beyond\n",
      "peacekeeping and disaster relief to long-term reconstruction and development.\n",
      "Haiti has the highest unemployment rate in the hemisphere; 70 percent of its people don't have jobs. It also has one of\n",
      "the region's highest population growth rates. Together, these trends have created what one development expert has\n",
      "called a \"youth tsunami\"-nearly 1 million youths are expected to come into the job market in the next five years.\n",
      "access to the U.S. market. Last October, we extended this trade preference for another decade. Apparel is one of the\n",
      "largest sectors in Haiti's economy. We see great potential for job creation in this field, and we are gratified by Brazil's\n",
      "interest in supporting the Haitian apparel industry as well.\n",
      "But to build a diversified economy, Haiti needs more than trade deals. It also needs the infrastructure to support the\n",
      "flow of goods and services. The roads in Haiti are beyond inadequate; many communities are isolated by the lack of a\n",
      "passable road, which prevents people from holding jobs, children from going to school, and farmers from bringing their\n",
      "crops to market.\n",
      "Better roads could facilitate greater trade and bring more Haitians into the global economy.\n",
      "Haiti also needs better roads in tourist areas, to promote that sector of the economy. Other urgent infrastructure needs\n",
      "include digging water catchments to prevent floods, completing a garment workers' training center, and creating canals\n",
      "to help irrigation.\n",
      "As part of the $287 million in non-emergency assistance we will provide to Haiti this year, we have authorized $20\n",
      "million in aid to generate jobs, to help people put their skills to work building their country's future. We look forward to\n",
      "working with Haiti to distribute that money quickly and effectively, to trigger a virtuous circle for long-term economic\n",
      "growth.\n",
      "All the fiscal responsibility in the world can't prevent a natural disaster.\n",
      "The hurricanes didn't just wash away crops and houses; they also washed away\n",
      "months of government planning for the future. Haiti is facing an\n",
      "approximately $50 million budget deficit, which could undermine Haiti's long-term ambitions as well as services that\n",
      "people depend on to survive.\n",
      "The United States will provide $20 million to pay Haiti's upcoming debt service obligations, to free Haiti to use its\n",
      "resources to fill that budget gap.\n",
      "[There is a fourth urgent need that the United States is committed to helping Haiti resolve. The combined effect of\n",
      "rising food prices globally and the destruction of crops by the hurricanes have exposed millions of Haitians to\n",

Полученную сумму делим на кол-во предложенных пар, в результате получаем некий аналог точности (accuracy).\n",
